### Prerequisites

- git: This is a version control system used for source code management.
- A text editor (e.g Visual Studio Code (recommended), Sublime Text, Atom etc.)
- Browser Engine on your terminal preferably NodeJs
- Knowledge of solidity, blockchain, and smart contracts

### Setup

- With git, clone the code to your machine, or download a ZIP of all the files directly.
- [Download the ZIP file from this location](https://github.com/mahdieh-dev/wave-portal-contract/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or run the following [git](https://git-scm.com/) command to clone the files to your machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/mahdieh-dev/wave-portal-contract.git
```

- Once the files are on your machine, open the **wave-portal-contract** folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).


## Install
